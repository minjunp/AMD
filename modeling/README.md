We implemented Multinomial Lasso Regression with L1 Penaly, Random Forest, and XGboost models to find important genes in all stages. Please access to individual model folders to see detailed analysis of each model.

In Multinomial Lasso regression model, training and testing are done in R. Cluseter heatmap, correlation matrix heatmap, and confusion matrix are visualized in Python.
